					Partnership. The data for all the indices was collected from

					<strong>Caveats</strong>
					<br />
				</p>
				<p>
					The index is limited by the{" "}
					<b>quality of data that is being released</b>, therefore
					many of the indicators still remain unknown and we are
					hoping to get more clarity as we work with governments and
					organizations to better refine this Index. The mapping to
					the sdgs while consistent across this data has been done to
					the best of our abilities and will probably change with time
					and with more information.
				</p>
